   Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000`

## 📊 Database Schema

The platform uses a secure PostgreSQL database with the following main tables:

### users
Stores user account information with hashed identifiers
- `user_id_hash`: SHA-256 hashed user identifier
- `username`: Display name
- `privacy_score`: Current privacy protection score
- `created_at`, `last_login`: Timestamp tracking

### encrypted_game_data
Securely stores encrypted game data
- `encrypted_payload`: AES-256-GCM encrypted game data
- `encryption_metadata`: Encryption parameters and security info
- `data_hash`: Data integrity verification hash

### privacy_assessments
Privacy risk assessment results and history
- `assessment_data`: Complete assessment responses
- `risk_score`: Calculated privacy risk (0-100)
- `risk_level`: Risk classification (Low/Medium/High)
- `recommendations`: Personalized improvement suggestions

### security_audit_log
Comprehensive security event logging
- `action_type`: Type of security action performed
- `resource_type`: Resource accessed or modified
- `details`: Additional context and metadata
- `timestamp`: When the action occurred

## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Encryption Standards
- **AES-256-GCM**: Authenticated encryption for data confidentiality and integrity
- **PBKDF2-SHA256**: Key derivation with 100,000 iterations
- **BLAKE3**: Modern cryptographic hashing for sensitive fields
- **SHA-256**: Standard hashing for user identifiers

### Security Features
